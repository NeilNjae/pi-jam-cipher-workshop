# pi-jam-cipher-workshop
Caesar cipher workshop for Raspberry Pi Jam

This workshop is about Caesar ciphers. In the first part, you'll write some Python code that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher. In the second part, you'll write some Python code which will automatically break Caesar ciphers: if you give it a message encrypted with a Caesar cipher, it will find the key used to encrypt it.

This workshop is suitable for all, but age 10+ is recommended. You don't need to have done any programming before.
