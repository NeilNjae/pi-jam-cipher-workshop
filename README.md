# pi-jam-cipher-workshop
Caesar cipher workshop for Raspberry Pi Jam

This workshop is about Caesar ciphers. In the first part, you'll write some Python code that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher. In the second part, you'll write some Python code which will automatically break Caesar ciphers: if you give it a message encrypted with a Caesar cipher, it will find the key used to encrypt it.

This workshop is suitable for all, but age 10+ is recommended. You don't need to have done any programming before.

## Want to know more?

I've written more about [writing programs for ciphers](https://work.njae.me.uk/tag/codes-and-ciphers/) on [my blog](https://work.njae.me.uk/). You can also grab more [code from Github](https://github.com/NeilNjae/cipher-tools/). Feel free to dive in and take a look!

## Working at home?

If you're doing this workshop at home, you'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (which should be installed already on a Raspberry Pi) and [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab). The quick way is to open a console and type in this command:

```
pip3 install jupyterlab
```

To copy this workshop onto your Raspberry Pi, you'll need to install the Git version control system and then download this repository. The quick way is to open a console and type in these two commands:

```
sudo apt install git
git clone git@github.com:NeilNjae/pi-jam-cipher-workshop.git
```

To open the project in Jupyter Lab, type these commands:

```
cd pi-jam-cipher-workshop
jupyter lab
```

See the [Raspberry Pi Git tutorial project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-git) for more on Git, such as "forking" this repository so you can save your progress. (Look in the [working with a sky-bag](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-git/10) and [pull requests](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-git/13) sections.)
