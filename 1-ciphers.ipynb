    "The [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is a simple cipher where each plaintext letter is shifted some positions along the alphabet to give the ciphertext letter. It can be used with two concentric wheel, like in the photo. You align the inner wheel with the appropriate part of the outer wheel. You can then find the plaintext letter in the inner wheel and the ciphertext letter is the corresponding one in the outer wheel.\n",

    "Encryption happens letter by letter. Non-letter characters generally stay the same. \n",

    "How should we go about writing a program to do this? \n",
    "\n",
    "As each letter is enciphered independently, we can do a very simple function to encipher a message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "to ceasar-encipher (message, shift):\n",
    "    for each character in message:\n",
    "        caesar-encipher-letter (character, shift)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can exploit that the deciphering is just enciphering with a negative shift, and write a very simple function to decipher a message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "to caesar-decipher (message, shift):\n",
    "    caesar-encipher (message, -shift)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we encipher a character? We need to be a bit *defensive* here, and account for the fact that we may be passed non-letters. We also have to think about how we want to handle upper- and lower-case letters. Should non-letters be removed from the result, kept unchanged, cause an error, or something else? Should all letters be converted to upper-case, or all converted to lowercase? \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be conservative here, and say that non-letters are retained unchanged, and the case of letters should be retained. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means I can write `caesar-encipher-letter` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "to caesar-encipher-letter(character, shift):\n",
    "    if character is a letter:\n",
    "        cipherletter = letter + shift\n",
    "        if character is uppercasea:\n",
    "            return uppercase(cipherletter)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return cipherletter\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return character\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only complication is the `letter + shift` bit: most programming languages will reject this statement as characters and numbers can't be added together.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll be doing a lot of this sort of thing in future, let's define a couple of utility functions which convert letters to their positions in the alphabet, and back again. Because we'll be using these functions a lot, I give them deliberately short names. `pos` finds the position of a letter in the alphabet, ignoring case, and `raise`ing an error if it's given something other than a letter.
